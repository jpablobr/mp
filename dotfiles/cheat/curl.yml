  curl - transfer a URL
  
  Synopsis:
  
    curl [options] [URL...]
  
  
  Command line internet/network loader tool and ajax test tool. Read the contents of a URL, dump the results to the stdout.
  
  
  To return the entire page to stdout:
  
    curl www.google.com
  
  
  To simulate wget by downloading a file at a specific web address, use the -O flag:
  
    curl -O www.example.com/img.gif
  
  
  To see if a site is alive, just get the headers (--head or -I):
  
    curl --head www.yahoo.com
  
  A live response returns status, cookies, content length, etc.
  
  
  To send custom headers (anything you want!) use (--header or -H):
  
    curl --header "User-Agent: something-special" example.com
    curl -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate" example.com
  
  
  To retrieve data with POST:
  
    curl -d "name1=a;name" www.google.com
  
  
  To simulate a form post:
  
    curl -F "variable=value;variable2=value2" http://localhost:3000/your/url
  
  
  This is helpful to get specific javascript back:
  
    curl -H "Accept: application/json" -i -X GET  http://localhost:3000/projects/3
  
  
  Delete via rest (or set other http methods with the -X flag):
  
    curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/projects/1
  
  
  Authenticate with username and password (http-basic if not specified otherwise):
  
    curl -u user:password http://example.com/whatever
  
  
  Save cookies to a file:
  
    curl -c cookies.txt \
         -F "username=meepo" -F "password=curiass" \
         http://example.com/login
  
  ... and pass the saved cookies back to the server:
  
    curl -b cookies.txt http://example.com/action
  
  Alternatively you can pass in cookies as key value pairs:
  
    curl -b key=value http://example.com/action
  
  Or using the custom header option:
  
    curl -H 'Cookie: key=value' http://example.com/action
