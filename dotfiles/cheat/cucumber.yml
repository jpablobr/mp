  =======\n\n  INSTALL cucumber & webrat (rspec rspec-rails)\n  =============================================\n  $ [sudo] gem install rspec rspec-rails cucumber webrat\n  \n  Starting from Cucumber 0.4.5 you will need the cucumber-rails gem\n\n  INSTALL DEPENDENCIES\n  ====================\n  $ [sudo] gem install term-ansicolor treetop diff-lcs nokogiri\n  \n  \n\
  BOOTSTRAP THE APP\n\
  =================\n  script/generate cucumber\n  \n  \n\
  HOW TO USE\n\
  ==========\n  \n  RAILS\n  =====\n  # Generate a basic feature and its step file,\n  # its better to make your own!\n  script/generate feature post\n  \n  # run your features\n  rake cucumber \n  \n  # run a specific feature\n  rake cucumber features/authentication.feature\n  \n  COMMAND LINE\n  ============\n  # run a specific scenario (this scenario starts on\n  # line 5 of authentication.feature)\n  cucumber features/authentication.feature:5\n  \n  \n  SAMPLE FEATURE DEFINITION\n  =========================\n  Feature: [feature name]\n    In order to [goal]\n    As a [stakeholder]\n    I want [behavior]\n\n  BUILT-IN WEBRAT STEPS\n  =====================\n  Given I am on [page_name]\n\n  When I go to [page_name]\n  When I press \"[button]\"\n  When I follow \"[link]\"\n  When I follow \"[link]\" within \"[parent]\"\n  When I fill in \"[field]\" with \"[value]\"\n  When I fill in \"[value]\" for \"[field]\"\n  When I fill in the following:\n    | field | value |\n\n  When I select \"[value]\" from \"[field]\"\n  When I select \"[time]\" as the date and time\n  When I select \"[datetime]\" as the \"[datetime_label]\" date and time\n  When I select \"[time]\" as the time\n  When I select \"[time]\" as the \"[time_label]\" time\n  When I select \"[date]\" as the date\n  When I select \"[date]\" as the \"[date_label]\" date\n  When I check \"[field]\"\n  When I uncheck \"[field]\"\n  When I choose \"[field]\"\n  When I attach the file \"[path]\" to \"[field]\"\n\n  Then I should see \"[text]\"\n  Then I should see \"[text]\" within \"[selector]\"\n  Then I should not see \"[text]\"\n  Then I should not see \"[text]\" within \"[selector]\"\n  Then the \"[field]\" field should contain \"[value]\"\n  Then the \"[field]\" field should not contain \"[value]\"\n  Then the \"[label]\" checkbox should be checked\n  Then the \"[label]\" checkbox should not be checked\n  Then I should be on [page_name]\n  Then show me the page\n\n\n\
  Developing with Cucumber and BDD\n\
  ================================\n\n  Business value and MMF\n  ======================\n  You should discuss the \xE2\x80\x9CIn order to\xE2\x80\x9D part of the feature and pop the why stack max 5 times (ask why recursively) until you end up with one of the following business values:\n\n  * Protect revenue\n  * Increase revenue\n  * Manage cost\n\n  If you\xE2\x80\x99re about to implement a feature that doesn\xE2\x80\x99t support one of those values, chances are you\xE2\x80\x99re about to implement a non-valuable feature. Consider tossing it altogether or pushing it down in your backlog. Focus on implementing the MMFs (Minimum Marketable Features) that will yield the most value.\n\n  Outcomes and bottom-up scenarios\n  ================================\n  The value provided by a system is what you can get out of it \xE2\x80\x93 not what you put into it (Chris Matts said that). Just like the value is expressed at the top of a feature (In order to\xE2\x80\xA6), the value should be in the steps of a scenarios too, more precisely in the Then steps.\n\n  When you\xE2\x80\x99re writing a new scenario, I recommend you start with the formulation of the desired outcome. Write the Then steps first. Then write the When step to discover the action/operation and finally write the Given steps that need to be in place in order for the When/Then to make sense.\n\n  Read more about cucumber:\n  * http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber\n  * http://cukes.info/"
