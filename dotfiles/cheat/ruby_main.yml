  This is useful in a library file (one containing classes etc. which is
  meant to be loaded via *require*, not run directly).
  
  If you want some code to be executed when the file is run directly,
  use the idiom above.
  
  In the past, this has been used to put *test* code in a library file,
  but these days unit testing is easy enough that such library self-
  testing is unnecessary.
  
  However, it's a useful little tool for experimenting with a library in
  the early stages of development, without stuffing up any code that
  requires the library.
