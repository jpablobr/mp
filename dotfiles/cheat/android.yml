  Creating a Project Without Eclipse
   $ android create project \
        --package com.android.helloandroid \
        --activity HelloAndroid \ 
        --target 2 \
        --path <path-to-your-project>/HelloAndroid 
  
  
  Running a Project
    Launch the Emulator (see AVD below):
      $ emulator -avd <your_avd_name>
      $ ant debug # compile and sign up with debug key 
      $ adb install /path/to/your/application.apk # Install to AVD 
  
     "If there is more than one emulator running, you must specify the 
     emulator upon which to install the application, by its serial number, 
     with the -s option.  For example:"
     $ adb -s emulator-5554 install /my/project/path/myapp.apk
  
  
  Android Virtual Device (AVD)
    This is the Android emulator, written in Java and available 
    for Windows, OS X, and Linux. 
    http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/avd.html
  
    Creating an AVD
      $ android create avd -n <name> -t <targetID> [-<option> <value>] ...
  
      Example: 
        Here's an example that creates an AVD with name "my_android1.5" 
        and target ID "2" (the  standard Android 1.5 system image in 
        the list above): 
  
        $ android create avd -n my_android1.5 -t 2
  
    Listing Targets
      $ android list targets
  
  
  Working with Virtual SD Cards
  ===============================================
  Creating an SD Card
    $ mksdcard 1024 1024.sdcard # bytes 
    $ mksdcard 128M 128M.sdcard 
    $ mksdcard 2048M 2gig.sdcard
  
  Mounting SD Card
    $ sudo mount -o loop 128M.sdcard /media/card
    $ sudo cp file1.mp3 file2.jpg file3.txt file4.txt /media/card
  
  Adding Card to AVD
    Make sure to unmount after copying files to card
    $ sudo umount /media/card
    $ ./android create avd --name myAVD --target 2 --sdcard 128M.sdcard
  
  If you get a warning that the SD card is locked, make sure: 
  "emulator: WARNING: ignoring locked SD Card image at"
    Emulator has permissions to read/write the card file
    Emulator has RWX access to the card file's directory
    I had problems with the card file being on a FAT32 partition. 
    Moving it to ext3 or reiserFS worked.

  Android and Google Maps API
  ================================================
  Use an AVD with target 3 for applications that use 
  the Google Maps API.
  
  Getting MD5 Fingerprint of SDK Debug Certificate
    You will need this key if you want to obtain a Google Maps API Key.
    This is necessary if you are using Google Maps in your Android app.
  
    * OS X and Linux: ~/.android/debug.keystore
    * Windows XP: C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\.android\debug.keystore
    * Windows Vista: C:\Users\<user>\.android\debug.keystore
  
    $ keytool -list -alias androiddebugkey \
    -keystore <path_to_debug_keystore>.keystore \
    -storepass android -keypass android
  
  Get a Google Maps API Key: 
    The link on the official android site is a 404
