  Ruby comments
  -------------
  
  Use the '#' symbol for a single-line comment:
  
  # This is a ruby-style comment.
  # It's more readable if you leave a space after the '#'
  
  
  In order to do multiline comments in ruby:
  
  =begin
  
  This is a lesser known (or at least less used) method of commenting in ruby.
  
  It allows you to comment out multiple lines without all the clutter at the beginning of each line.
  
  It also allows you to make cool ASCII art:
  
  RRRRR    U     U  BBBBB   Y     Y
  R    R   U     U  B    B   Y   Y
  R    R   U     U  B    B    Y Y
  RRRRR    U     U  BBBBB      Y
  R   R    U     U  B    B     Y
  R    R   U     U  B    B     Y
  R     R   UUUUU   BBBBB      Y
  
  =end
  
  Make those comments!
