assert_difference: |-
  assert_difference is a nice clean assertion for your testing suite.
  
  To use:
  
    assert_difference 'Model.count' do
      # some action (probably create) that will increase Model.count by 1
    end
  
    assert_difference 'Model.count', 23 do
      # some action that will increase Model.count by 23
    end
  
    assert_difference 'Model.count', -1 do
      # something to decrease Model.count, probably a destroy call
    end
  
  
  
    You can even assert_difference of more than 1 value ala 
      assert_difference ['Model.count', 'var_affected_by_same_action'] do 
        #....
      end
