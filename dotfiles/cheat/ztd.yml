  The Four Habits
  -------------
  1. Collect
    * Write down any tasks, ideas, projects, or other information that pop into your head.
    * Get it out of your head and onto paper.
  
  2. Process
   * Make quick decisions on things in your inbox, do not put them off.
   * Do it!, Trash it, Delegate it, File it (someday/maybe), calendar for later
  
  3. Plan
    *  Each day, create a list of 1-3 Most Important Tasks (your Big Rocks for the day) and be sure to accomplish them.
    * Do your MITs early in the day to get them out of the way and enjoy the rest of the day.
  
  4. Do
    * One task at a time, without distractions.
    * This is one of the most important habits in ZTD: Select a task (preferably one of your MITs) and focus on it to the exclusion of all else.
