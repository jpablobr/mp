  # Taskr is a stand-alone HTTP daemon, providing a cron-like networked
  # scheduling service. Tasks are created and managed via a REST calls over
  # HTTP, allowing other REST-aware services to schedule and manage jobs.
  
  # One common use for Taskr is to schedule jobs to be executed on 
  # remote Rails servers. However, Taskr is a far more generic tool, 
  # capable of performing a wide range of scheduled actions.
