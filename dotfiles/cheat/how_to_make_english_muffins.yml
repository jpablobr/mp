  English Muffins by Jonah Schulz
  After some fiddling with a basic bread recipe, and consulting whatever data I have collected in my brain every time I bake anything, I devised this recipe.
  3 cups of flour(2-1 all-purpose to whole wheat is what I did, but feel free to experiment)
  2.5 tsp wheat gluten
  2 tsp salt
  1 .5 tsp sugar
  2 tsp instant yeast
  150 ml warm water
  150 ml milk
  1 Tbsp Barley Malt(dissolve it in the water and milk)
  
  Combine the dry ingredients well in a large bowl. Add the water/milk/malt mixture and stir with a wooden spoon or your hand until a soft, smooth dough forms, adjusting with additional water or flour if necessary. You con't really want to knead it very much, and if the dough feels right you can simply leave it in the bowl and cover it with plastic wrap or a damp towel until the dough has doubled in size.
  Seperate the dough into 12 pieces and roll into balls, then flatten until 3/4" thick and transfer to a lightly floured board. Cover with a cloth(or reuse that same piece of plastic wrap) and let rise until doubled in size.
  Heat a heavy pan(preferably cast iron) until very hot and cook the muffins a few at a time until brown(but not burnt) on both sides(approx. 3 minutes per side).
