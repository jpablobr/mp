  Since Netbeans V6.0 there is Rails-Support built in - compared to Radrails Rails-Support in Netbeans is awesome!
  
  Download: 
  [stable]  http://download.netbeans.org/netbeans/6.0/final/
  [nightly] http://bits.netbeans.org/download/trunk/nightly/latest/ (normally quite usable)
  => just download the ruby/rails-prepackaged Netbeans - if you need more functionality
  you can add it via the plugin-manager
  
  Installation:
  You need an up-to-date Java-SDK (JRE is not enough)
  
  You get:
  * Nice & Fast Inline-Code-Documentation of Rails/Ruby
  * Nice & Fast Code-Completation
  * Nice & Fast Code-Templates
  * Rails 2.0.2 Support
  * Out-Of-The-Box-Working Debugger
  * Built-In SVN
  * Built-In "Goto-File"
  * etc.pp.
  
  Try Netbeans and forget about Radrails! ;)
