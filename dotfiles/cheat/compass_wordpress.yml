compass_wordpress: |-
  To install a theme, add this to your compass.rb file:
  
    ## This assumes '.'
    require 'compass-wordpress'
  
    ## An alternate command to run:
    compass -r compass-wordpress -f wordpress --sass-dir=sass --css-dir=css -s compressed -p <Theme Name> /path/to/installation
  
  What this does is call compass, requires the compass-wordpress extension, uses the framework wordpress, sets the sass and css directories, sets the Sass output to be compressed and finally ends with you setting the theme name.
