  ------------------------------------------------

    .           Any single character
    [chars]     Character class: One  of chars

  Quantifiers:
    ?           0 or 1 of the preceding text
    *           0 or N of the preceding text (N > 0)
    +           1 or N of the preceding text (N > 1)
  
  Grouping:
    (text)      Grouping of text
                (either to set the borders of an alternative or
                for making backreferences where the Nth group can 
                be used on the right of a RewriteRule with $N)
  
  Anchors:
    ^           Start of line anchor
    $           End   of line anchor
  
  Escaping:
    \char       escape that particular char
                (for instance to specify the chars ".[]()" etc.)
  
  [L]           stop rewrite here
  [N]           re-run rules from start - watch for loops!
  [C]           chain with next rule - if no match, following
                chained rules are ignored
