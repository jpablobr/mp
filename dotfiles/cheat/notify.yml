  Some quick & dirty notifications (for OS X):
  
  For more info: http://www.elctech.com/2007/12/21/notify-me-when-done
  
  $ cmd; say "Don't care how it finished, but it did"
  $ cmd && say "Success!"
  $ (cmd && say "Success") || say "Failed"
  
  Example:
  $ mysql app_dev < dump.sql && say "Finished importing"
  
  
  Quicksilver:
  $ cmd; osascript -e 'tell application "Quicksilver" to show large type "Finished!"'
  
  Growl:
  $ cmd; growlnotify -s -m "Done"
  
  Note: If you are using Leopard, there's a bug with growlnotify as of version 1.1.2 (*fixed in 1.1.3) that prevents growlnotify from working consistently. However, there's an easy workaround.
  
      * Open up the Growl preference pane and select the Network tab.
      * Click to enable "Listen for incoming notifications".
      * Now when you run growlnotify, add the "-H localhost" option.
  
  $ cmd && growlnotify -s -H localhost -m "Success"
  
  If you are using wmii, you can have it change your tag when it is done
  
  $ cmd && wmiir xwrite /lbar/tagname "*tagname"
