java: |-
  Java is a high quality (open source) object oriented programming language which has gained immense popularity worldwide.
  
  Java was originally developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform.
  
  The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++ but has a simpler object model and fewer low-level facilities.
  
  Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.
  
  Java was designed to be platform independent - "write once run anywhere".
