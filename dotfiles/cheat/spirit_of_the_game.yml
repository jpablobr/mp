  Excerpts from the Official Rules of Ultimate: 11th Edition
  
  From the Preface: "The integrity of Ultimate depends on each player's
  responsibility to uphold the Spirit of the Game, and this responsibility
  should remain paramount."
  
  From Section 1: "Ultimate relies upon a spirit of sportsmanship that places
  the responsibility for fair play on the player. Highly competitive play is
  encouraged, but never at the expense of mutual respect among competitors,
  adherence to the agreed upon rules, or the basic joy of play. Protection of
  these vital elements serves to eliminate unsportsmanlike conduct from the
  Ultimate field. Such actions as taunting opposing players, dangerous
  aggression, belligerent intimidation, intentional infractions, or other
  'win-at-all-costs' behavior are contrary to the Spirit of the Game and must
  be avoided by all players."
