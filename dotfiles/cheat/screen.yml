  =TO START SCREEN=
  $ screen
  $ screen -ls: to list running sessions
  
  From: http://www.amitu.com/blog/2004/12/screen-howto.html
  To connect to an already open session running in background, use "screen" with following options:
     * -D -R  Attach here and now. In detail this means: If a session is running, then reattach. If necessary detach and logout remotely first. If it was not running create it and notify the user. This is the author's favorite.
     * -r     Reattach to existing
     * -d -r  Reattach a session and if necessary detach it first.
     * -d -R  Reattach a session and if necessary detach or even create it first.
     * -d -RR Reattach a session and if necessary detach or create it. Use the first session if more than one session is available.
     * -D -r  Reattach a session. If necessary detach and logout remotely first.
     * -D -RR Attach here and now. Whatever that means, just do it.
  
     * -r <PID> Reattach to the session with process ID of <PID>

  =SCREEN COMMANDS (run within screen):=
  All commands called from the "meta key": C-a (ctrl+a).  Note: Case-sensitive.
  Note: For 'old' ctrl-a, use C-a-a
  
  C-a ?: Help (shows a list of commands)
      (On some systems C-a h reportedly also works.)
  C-a c: Create new window/terminal
  C-a k: Kill window session
  C-a d: Detaches from the window
  C-a DD: Detaches from the window AND the ssh shell if you are in one.
  C-a x: Lock the current screen session with the current user's password.
  
  To select a window:
  C-a " (quote): List windows: (select one and press enter)
  C-a <digit> (the number of the screen)
  C-a n,  C-a p: Next/Previous screen
  
  Split screens:
  C-a S: Split (then use C-tab, C-<num>)
  C-a tab: Move between splits
  C-a Q: Un-Split
  C-a :resize +N  : increase current region height by N
  C-a :resize -N  : decrease current region height by N
  C-a :resize N   : set current region height to N
  C-a :resize =   : make all windows equally high
  C-a :resize max : maximize current region height
  C-a :resize min : minimize current region height
  
  After creating a new window it is useful to name it:
    C-a A and enter a name.
  
  To create a named window directly:
    C-a :, and type screen <command>.
  
  Copy mode so you can scroll up and down.:
    C-a ESC
  
  Copy and Paste:
  C-a [:	 Enables copy mode
  C-a ]:	 Pastes buffer ('clipboard')
  C-a <:	 Copy from a file
  C-a >:	 Paste to a file
  
  Monitoring:
  C-a M: Toggles alert on activity
  C-a _ (underscore): Toggles monitor for silence
  C-a " (quote): Jump to alerting window
