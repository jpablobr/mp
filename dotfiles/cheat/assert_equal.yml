  assert_equal(expected, actual, message=nil)
  
  Passes if expected == +actual.
  
  Note that the ordering of arguments is important, since a helpful error message is generated when this one fails that tells you the values of expected and actual.
  
  Example:
  
    assert_equal 'MY STRING', 'my string'.upcase
