  REST
  $ ruby script/generate scaffold_resource Model columnname:columntype --skip-migration
  
  
  The Payoff:
   * You get a starter set of functional tests for your controller. Keep your tests passing and you'll know your REST design is still intact.
   * A controller named Products with all of the canonical CRUD actions defined for you with boilerplate code. Comments with the routing paths (url pattern + http verb) to invoke that action. An HTTP XML API defined.
   * Boilerplate views for four of the CRUD actions (you'll just need to fill in your model's details in the forms).
   * A migration script. Define your table here, then run rake db:migrate.
   * map.resources :models line at the top of routes.rb.
