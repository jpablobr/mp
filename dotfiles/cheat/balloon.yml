  Balloon, another great service created and provided by our benevolent overlord _why.  Run programs without going through the trouble of downloading and installing the application or its libraries.  Definitely read help page for _why's disclaimers.

  To make running balloons very easy you can install the handy 'blow' command (by hank):
  $ sudo ruby -ropen-uri -e 'eval(open("http://balloon.hobix.com/blow").read)'
  
  after that you can run the balloon named 'me' by just running:
  $ blow me
