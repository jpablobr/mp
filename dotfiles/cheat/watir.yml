watir: |-
  for windows users
  =================
  
  == install ruby first.
  Use windows one-click installer 1.8.6 (26)
  http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=167
  install into default location c:\ruby
  
  == update rubygems
  the default rubygems on that ruby installer is old.
  $ gem update --system
  if you are behind firewall use proxy server settings
  $ gem update --system -p http://host:port
  or set environment var
  $ set HTTP_PROXY=http://host:port
  
  == Install watir 
  gem (currently 1.6.5)
  $ gem install watir
  
  == watir-console (irb = interactive ruby)
  start cmd.exe windows terminal and execute this
  $ watir-console
  you will get a prompt to talk to ruby. 
  watir-console is a watir executable that invokes IRB.
  study it here c:\ruby\lib\bin\watir-console
  
  >> browser = Watir::Browser.start "http://watir.com/"
  => #<Watir::IE:0x2d5d00c url="http://watir.com/" title="Watir">
  
  the above commands will start default browser (IE) and navigate to watir.com
  use irb to talk to the browser
  >> browser.class #=> Watir::IE class that talks to IE on windows
  >> Watir::IE::VERSION #=> will output the version of watir library (1.6.5)
  
  all the commands you enter into watir-console will be automatically saved in 'console.log' file in your current working directory.
  $ Dir.pwd #=> this will tell you what directory you are in and where to find your 'console.log' file.
  
  >> require 'pp' #=> this will make pretty printing of objects, just do it
  
  Here are class methods of Watir::IE
  >> pp browser.class.methods(false).sort
  There are about 20.
  get familiar with the following
  ["attach", "close_all", "find", "start",]
  example: attach to the window with a title Watir
  >>browser = Watir::IE.attach(:title, /Watir/)
  
  Here are instance methods
  >> pp browser.class.instance_methods(false).sort
  that's about 70 useful methods. 
  Now you can experiment with browser object started with Watir::IE
  
  browser.class is the same as Watir::IE so in this example
  the above command is the same as this
  >> pp Watir::IE.instance_methods(false).sort
  
  
  Find methods
  >> pp Watir::IE.instance_methods.grep(/show_/)
  ["show_frames",
   "show_active",
   "show_images",
   "show_divs",
   "show_links",
   "show_tables",
   "show_forms",
   "show_pres",
   "show_all_objects",
   "show_spans",
   "show_labels"]
  => nil
  
  The show methods are great in showing what's in the DOM
  example on watir.com
  >> browser.show_forms
  There are 1 forms
  Form name:
         id: search_form
     method: get
     action: http://watir.com/
