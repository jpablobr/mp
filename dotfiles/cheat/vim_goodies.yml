  to get direct access from vim to your cheat-sheets add something like this to 
  your .vimrc
  map <F3> :!cheat<SPACE>
  
  or
  
  com -nargs=* Cheat :r ! cheat <args>
  
  which lets you :Cheat sheet
  
  
  Alternatively, you can install the Cheat vim plugin:
  http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=2015
  
  which, besides offering the :Cheat command it also has tab completion for 
  cheat sheets names, the <leader>C shortcut to the :Cheat command as well 
  as searching for a cheat sheet based on the current keyword (e.g. if the 
  cursor is on a word like "ambition", pressing <leader>ch will bring the 
  ambition cheatsheet).
  
  
  wonderful support for ruby within vim is available after
  $ sudo gem install vim-ruby
  just follow the instructions afterwards
