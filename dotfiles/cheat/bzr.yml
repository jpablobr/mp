  Setup:
    $ bzr whoami "Frank Chu <fchu@example.com>"
  
  Creating a new branch:
    $ bzr init ProjectDirectory
    $ cd ProjectDirectory
  
  Creating a new branch for an existing project that's not in source control:
    $ cd ExistingProject
    $ bzr init
    $ bzr add
    $ bzr commit -m "Initial import of ExistingProject."
  
  Status of working copy:
    $ bzr status
  
  Difference between the last commitment and the working copy:
    $ bzr diff
  
  Committing changes in working copy:
    $ bzr commit [-m "Comment to the commitment"]
  
  Rollback:
    $ bzr uncommit
  
  Looking though logs:
    $ bzr log
  
  Making a new copy of an existing branch:
    $ bzr branch ProjectDirectory RadicalRefactor
    $ cd RadicalRefactor; # Go nuts!
  Making a local copy of an external branch:
    $ bzr branch http://bazaar-vcs.org/bzr/bzr.dev.
    $ cd bzr.dev
  
  Exposing and updating a branch to the web
  If the server does not have bzr installed:
    $ bzr push sftp://user@example.com/your/web/directory/ProjectDirectory
  Fast access, if server has bzr installed:
    $ bzr push bzr+ssh://user@example.com/your/web/directory/ProjectDirectory
  Now people can grab your repository with:.
    $ bzr branch http://example.com/your/web/directory/ProjectDirectory
  
  Creating a merge request for an upstream bzr branch:
  Send the maintainer an email:
    $ bzr send http://project.example.com/upstream/branch
  Create a merge bundle file (containing a readable diff):
    $ bzr send http://project.example.com/upstream/branch -o my_feature.patch
