blender: |-
  No control buttons
   - everything is done directly with the keyboard keys
  
  Adding a new object
   - Space Bar
  
  Mark all objects
   - A
  
  Delete all currently marked objects
   - X
  
  Scale all objects
   - N
   - <Tab>
   - <Tab>... until in the object properties window
     the scale appears
  
  Blender Units are all millimeter --> 12.123 --> 12 mm --> 1.2 cms
  
  Remove duplicate vertices - important for gcode generation
  
  1. Hit Tab to enter Mesh Edit mode
  2. Hit A to select all nodes (everything goes yellow and purple)
  3. Type W6 or select Mesh -> Vertices -> Remove Doubles
  
  
  A few UI tips:
  
   - the 'A' key toggles between select all and select none
   - the right key is how you select objects
   - the tab key will take you between object and mesh mode
   - holding middle click will allow you to move your view. scrolling it will zoom.
   - the num pad keys will give you good default views if you get lost
   - the 'X' key will allow you to delete objects, like the default cube when you open blender
  
  Find non-manifold points
  
  Non-manifold points are points that just don't make sense in the real world. These can be hanging points, internal surfaces, holes, zero-thickness walls, etc. Unfortunately there is no way to automatically fix them in software. The best you can do is to identify the problems and then attempt to fix them.
  
  1. Hit Tab to enter Mesh Edit mode
  2. Hit A to deselect all nodes (everything goes gray and pink)
  3. Select Select -> Non-Manifold
  
  If there are non-manifold points, they will be selected. If nothing happens, you're golden. 
  If there are problems, then you can see what's wrong and attempt to fix it.
  
  Importing SVGs
  
   - import and then
   - Alt-C converts them to mesh that can be extruded and worked on
  
  Extrude (create a new point)
   - E (z,y,x to lock to one coordinate)
  
  Goto (move existing point)
   - G (z,y,x to lock to one coordinate)
  
  Create a face between points
   - Select the two points (right mouse button and shift-RMB)
   - F
   - shift-F to create face using triangles
  
  Converting Fonts to Meshes
   - Having entered the text, switch to object mode
   - (Edit mode is used to enter text)
   - Add a new object
   - Select the old text object
   - Alt-C
   - Text is no mesh!
  
  Move cursor to the origin
   - Shift-C in edit mode (and object mode?)
  
  Join / Combine meshes
   - Object Mode --> J
   - Edit Mode --> P
